### What I learned

Hi, I hope you're doing well today. I want to share with you this interesting and hopefully useful project where I focused on really sharpening my knowledge of basic web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JS, combining what I learned in my recent journey where I took a deep dive into understanding and learning as much as I can about networking, HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, CORS, IP addresses, DNS, URIs, and APIs, which really influenced me to take this step and build this project.

I wanted to really push my limits, so I chose to look for an API that’s not commonly used in tutorials so I could really test my knowledge on this subject. Needless to say, there were multiple roadblocks: poor documentation, weird responses...

but I’m proud that I took that step because it really made me familiar with what an API structure looks like, and overall, it was just nice practicing what I was seeing and making it happen.

### Continued development

There will be upcoming updates to this project for sure I’m planning to integrate a resume upload feature that will help users get feedback on what to work on and to make the website able to integrate with the Notion API so users can avoid the hassle of keeping track of their applications manually.
